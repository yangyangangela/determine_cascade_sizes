The code used for simulations described in the paper

Yang Yang, Takashi Nishikawa, and Adilson Motter
Vulnerability and Cosusceptibility Determine the Size of Network Cascades
Phys. Rev. Lett. 118, 048301 (2017)
http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.118.048301

is included in the following folders:

1) cascade_model: simulation of the iterative physical cascade model based on DC power flow calculations.

2) co_susceptible_groups: algorithm for identifying co-susceptible groups for a given correlation matrix. 

For instructions on how to use them, see readme.txt in the corresponding folders.
